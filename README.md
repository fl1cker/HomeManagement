# HomeManagement
A website for maintenance and appointment reminders for all things domestic (appliance servicing, bills, doc appointments, etc)

Design Thoughts:
Will be hosted locally on a laptop in the house
Touchscreen monitor in the living room would be great for navigating (large buttons, simple layout)

Screens:
Day at a glance
Week at a glance

Maintenance -- home, car, bike, cat flea treatment, etc
Appointments -- 
Events --
Reminders to call family

Each tab is really just a filter on data that has the same object type:
1) name
2) description
3) time
4) reminder time
5) frequency
6) importance
7) phone number
8) address
9) category
10) owner (me, spouse, both)
